"""Splitting is the 3d stage of the Speech-to-Text workflow.

Status: `ADJUSTED -> SPLITTED`

Operations:
- apply split-on-silence procedure
- (optionally) if having big latency_ratio or the accumulated segment is 
  too long â€” apply a more aggressive splitting procedure (to prevent growing 
  delay in application response)

Possible results:
- one or more splits
    - the last segment becomes a new `ongoing_seg`
    - the others become `to_be_finalized_segs`
- no splits, but maybe trimming the following silence
    - `ongoing_seg` is updated
    - `to_be_finalized_segs` stays empty
- no splits, the output is empty
    - `ongoing_seg` is considered to be fully silent
